 * = SAMD10 I2C server =
 *
 * This I2C server opens up the entire SAMD10 chip to be used anyway anyone likes.
 * The server only has three commands, read one 32 bit memory location, write one
 * 32 bit memory location and execute from a location.
 * Effectively this means that the user can access any memory location and/or any
 * control register in the device thus exposing all the functionality that the
 * device has. You can also upload short programs and execute them inside the
 * SAMD10 device, making the Workstation40 board a very powerfull I/O processor.
 *
 * == I2C operations ==
 *
 * === Read memory location ===
 * A read operation consists of an initial 32 bit write operation that contains the
 * memory location that should be read, followed by a a 32 bit read operation of
 * the value.
 *
 * === Write memory location ===
 * A write operation consists of an initial 32 bit write operation that contains
 * the memory location that shall be written. This is immediatly followed by a
 * 32 bit write operation with the data that shall be written.
 *
 * === Execute from Location ===
 * This operation allows the user to execute code from inside the SAMD10 device.
 * The execute from location command is a special case of the write memory
 * location command. A memory address of 0xffffffff is interpreted as the special
 * command execute from location and the value is used as the jump address.
 *
 * == Caution ==
 * Read and write operation must be carried out on a valid function register or
 * memory address, furthermore the address that you supply must also be on an even
 * 32 bit boundary, otherwise the device will crash and must be reset.
 * Future releases will include a fault detect mechanism that will catch this and
 * signal an interrupt to the ESP210, but for now, do take care when programming.
